# Heart-Disease-Prediction
❤️ Heart Stroke Prediction System
📖 Overview

The Heart Stroke Prediction System is a Machine Learning–based application designed to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on key medical and lifestyle features such as age, gender, hypertension, glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and heart disease history.

The goal of this project is to assist in early risk assessment and demonstrate how machine learning can be applied in real-world healthcare scenarios.

🎯 Problem Statement

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide.
Early identification of individuals at high risk of stroke can help in taking preventive measures and improving patient outcomes.

However, predicting stroke risk is challenging because it depends on multiple medical and lifestyle factors such as age, blood pressure, glucose level, BMI, smoking habits, and existing health conditions.

The objective of this project is to:

Build a machine learning model that can predict the probability of stroke based on patient data

Identify the most important features contributing to stroke risk

Provide a reliable and scalable solution for early stroke risk prediction

🧠 Solution Approach

To solve this problem, the following steps were performed:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values and outliers

Feature encoding and scaling using StandardScaler

Model training using multiple algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest

Model evaluation using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Selection of the best-performing model

Saving the trained model using Joblib


🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
